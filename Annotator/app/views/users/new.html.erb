 <h4>
Procedure
</h4>
<br>
<p>
As a participant in the study, you will be provided with a randomly shuffled list of tweets, one tweet at a time. The task is simply to choose whether you believe the intended meaning of the tweet was positive, sarcastic or negative. All tweets themselves will be anonymous (user names will be removed).  Your contribution as a participant will be used anonymously.  You may abandon the study at any point should they wish to do so.  If for any reason you wish for your input to be deleted, please do not hesitate to email me at the email below and the data will be destroyed.
